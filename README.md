## **2. 🚀 Project Overview**  
**EduBridge** is a free, community-powered education app designed to democratize learning for Bangladeshi students (Grades 8-12, IELTS/Spoken English learners). Built with **Flutter (MVVM)** and **Supabase**, it enables peer-to-peer knowledge sharing through localized Bengali content, interactive MCQs, and a donation-based reward system. Unlike paid platforms, EduBridge turns students into both learners and teachers, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where smartphones become tools for accessible education.

### **3. 🎯 Key Goals**  

- **Eliminate Financial Barriers** → Provide 100% free, high-quality educational resources tailored to the Bangladeshi curriculum.  
- **Foster Collaborative Learning** → Empower students to upload/share videos, notes, and MCQs (like an "educational Stack Overflow").  
- **Localize Content** → Deliver Bengali-medium lessons with instant feedback, addressing gaps in global platforms (Coursera, Udemy).  
- **Leverage Technology for Scale** → Use **Supabase** (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage) for cost-effective backend operations. Adopt **MVVM** for clean, maintainable Flutter code.  
- **Build a Sustainable Model** → Encourage donations to content creators (peer rewards, not paid subscriptions).  
- **Future-Proof Education** → Pilot AI-driven tutoring and vocational training to combat unemployment.  

---

### **🌟 Why This Matters**  
- **Impact**: 60% of Bangladeshi students lack access to quality tutors. EduBridge bridges this gap.  
- **Innovation**: First community-driven app combining peer learning + donations in Bangladesh.  
- **Scalability**: Designed to expand into AI/gamification with Supabase’s flexibility.  

--- 

### **📝 Example Use Case**  
*A rural student (Grade 10) watches a peer-uploaded math video in Bengali, solves MCQs with instant feedback, and donates ৳10 to the creator—all without expensive coaching.*
