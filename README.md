## 🚀 **Project Overview**  
**EduBridge** is a free, community-powered education app designed to democratize learning for Bangladeshi students (Grades 8-12, IELTS/Spoken English learners). Built with **Flutter (MVVM)** and **Supabase**, it enables peer-to-peer knowledge sharing through localized Bengali content, interactive MCQs, and a donation-based reward system.  

Unlike paid platforms, EduBridge turns students into both learners and teachers, creating a self-sustaining ecosystem where smartphones become tools for accessible education.  

---

## 🎯 **Key Goals**  
📌 **Eliminate Financial Barriers** → Provide 100% free, high-quality educational resources tailored to the Bangladeshi curriculum.  
📌 **Foster Collaborative Learning** → Empower students to upload/share videos, notes, and MCQs (like an "educational Stack Overflow").  
📌 **Localize Content** → Deliver Bengali-medium lessons with instant feedback, addressing gaps in global platforms (Coursera, Udemy).  
📌 **Leverage Technology for Scale** → Use **Supabase** (Auth, PostgreSQL, Storage) for cost-effective backend operations. Adopt **MVVM** for clean, maintainable Flutter code.  
📌 **Build a Sustainable Model** → Encourage donations to content creators (peer rewards, not paid subscriptions).  
📌 **Future-Proof Education** → Pilot AI-driven tutoring and vocational training to combat unemployment.  

---

## 🌟 **Why This Matters**  
- 📌 **Impact**: 60% of Bangladeshi students lack access to quality tutors. EduBridge bridges this gap.  
- 📌 **Innovation**: First community-driven app combining peer learning + donations in Bangladesh.  
- 📌 **Scalability**: Designed to expand into AI/gamification with Supabase’s flexibility.  

---  

## 🔧 **Technical Alignment**  
- **Flutter MVVM**: Ensures testable, modular code (Views ↔ ViewModels ↔ Supabase).  
- **Supabase**: Handles auth, user-generated content, and donations securely.  

## 🏗️ **System Architecture**  
📌 **MVVM Pattern** (ViewModel ↔ Model ↔ View)  
📌 **Component diagram** (Flutter ↔ Supabase)  
📌 **Data flow** (User → App → Supabase)  

## 🗃️ **Database Design**
